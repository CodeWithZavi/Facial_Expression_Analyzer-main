PROJECT TITLE: Facial Expression Analyzer

INTRODUCTION: The Facial Expression Analyzer is a real-time computer
vision and deep learning project. It detects human faces through a
webcam and predicts emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise,
Neutral, and Disgust.

OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this project is to analyze facial
expressions in real time using artificial intelligence and display the
detected emotion on the screen.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: 1. Programming Language: Python 2. Libraries and
Tools: - OpenCV (for webcam access and face detection) - TensorFlow /
Keras (for loading the trained deep learning model) - NumPy (for
numerical operations)

PROJECT WORKING: 1. The webcam is accessed using OpenCV. 2. Each frame
from the webcam is converted to grayscale. 3. Haar Cascade Classifier is
used to detect faces in the frame. 4. The detected face is resized to
64x64 pixels. 5. The image is normalized and passed to the trained CNN
model. 6. The model predicts the emotion. 7. The emotion label is
displayed on the webcam screen.

MODEL DETAILS: The emotion detection model is a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) trained on facial expression images. The model expects
grayscale images of size 64x64.

FEATURES: - Real-time emotion detection - Face detection using Haar
Cascade - Live webcam processing - Simple and user-friendly

APPLICATIONS: - Human emotion analysis - AI-based surveillance - Smart
classroom systems - Mental health analysis - Interview behavior analysis

ADVANTAGES: - Fast and real-time processing - High accuracy with trained
CNN model - Easy to use and understand

LIMITATIONS: - Requires good lighting - Performance depends on webcam
quality - Limited emotion categories

FUTURE SCOPE: - Add more emotions - Improve accuracy using better
datasets - Mobile application integration - Emotion-based
recommendations

CONCLUSION: The Facial Expression Analyzer successfully demonstrates the
use of computer vision and deep learning to recognize human emotions in
real time. It is a useful and practical AI project for learning and
real-world applications.
